## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- MongoDB (running locally or accessible via URI)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BedoNassef71/lms-microservice-api.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd grades
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Define environment variables required for the application, such as:
   - `PORT`: Port number for the Express.js server (default: 3004)
   - `DATABASE_URI`: URI for connecting to MongoDB

Example `.env` file:

```plaintext
PORT=3004
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/grades
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

## Usage

Start the application by running:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start listening on the specified port (default: 3004).

## Endpoints

The application provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /grades`: Assign a grade to a student.
- `GET /grades`: Retrieve grades for the authenticated user.
- `GET /grades/:courseId`: Retrieve grades for a specific course.
- `PATCH /grades`: Update an existing grade for a student.

Refer to the API documentation or source code for more details on each endpoint.

## Security Considerations

Ensure the following security measures are in place:

- Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between client and server.
- Implement input validation and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as JWT with bcrypt for password hashing.
- Set security headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
